<!-- By default the thermostat type devices will inherit all
	 ThermostatAction actions, which will be dispatched to
	 the actionControlThermostat() method defined in plugin.py.
	 
	 Additional custom actions can also be defined here. The
	 example below defines a custom action to modify the brightness
	 of the backlit display of the module, and to modify the custom
	 backlightBrightness state added to Devices.xml.

			<Name>Get The Latest Data for the Weather Station</Name>
