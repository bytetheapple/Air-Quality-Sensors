# Air Quality Sensors
 IndigoDomo plugin - Reads Air Sensor Data

Configure your GPS location when you install this plugin.
Create devices that pull data from the nearest AirNow sensor or from the nearest Purple Air Sensor

When creating a device for a Purple Air sensor you can specify the name or ID of the sensor you want to track rather than having the plugin find the nearest sensor.

You can also create a virtual sensor from the 5 closest Purple Air sensors.   This dev will sample 5 local sensors and average the results
